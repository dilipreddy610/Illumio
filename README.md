I have used the concept of Least Frequently used cache inorder to store the most frequently used rules in the cache. I implemented this using map which stores the frequency of usage of every rule. 

I have tested my code by writing Junit test cases for every parameter passed to the accept packet method. These tests cases help in testing  random inputs to the method and handles edge cases on IP address which is given as input.

I have also uploaded the file named approaches.docx describing various other approaches that can be used to solve the problem. Each approach has its own advantages and disadvantages

I am really interested in working Platform team and Data team and Platform team is my first priority.
